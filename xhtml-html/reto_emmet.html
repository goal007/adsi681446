That’s because iOS was designed to be easy to understand. The simple-yet-beautiful Home screen invites you to discover each of the built-in apps. So right away, you’re browsing your favorite websites, capturing a few candids, or texting your friends. And no matter what you’re doing or what app you’re using, everything feels easy, intuitive, and even fun.}+h3{Hardware and Software made for each other}+p{Because Apple makes both the hardware and the operating system for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch, everything is designed to work together. So apps take full advantage of hardware features such as the dual-core processor, accelerated graphics, wireless antennas, and more. Multitasking is a perfect example. iOS 7 learns when you like to use your apps and updates the content in them at power-efficient times, like when your device is already in use and connected to Wi-Fi. So the content in your favorite apps stays up to date without a major drain on your battery.}+h3{Whit the App Store}+p{iOS is the platform for hundreds of thousands of mobile apps — over 900,000 and counting.7 And every app starts with the right DNA. That’s because Apple gives third-party developers a rich set of tools and APIs to create apps and games that take advantage of the technology inside every iOS device. With all those apps in one place, they’re easy to access, easy to search, and easy to buy using the same account you use for iTunes. Just browse the App Store on your iOS device and download them with a tap.}+a[id readmore class=read1]{Leer mas...})+(section#android>article>h1{Android}+img[src=images/logo_android.png]+h3{Choose the Android device that’s right for you}+p{Android powers devices from some of the best phone and tablet makers in the world, like Samsung, HTC, LG, Motorola, Sony, Asus, and more.
